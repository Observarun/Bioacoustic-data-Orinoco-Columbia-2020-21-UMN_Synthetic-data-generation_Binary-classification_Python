# Binary Species Classification and Augmentation on Bio-acoustic Data


<!--## Business Case-->
## Motivation and overview

Human activity and climate change have been placing ever increasing pressure on biodiversity. A common problem of interest in conservation biology and ecology research is to detect the presence of a wildlife species in a region. Acoustic monitoring, which is a technique that uses certain electronic devices to capture animal sounds, is seeing growing use in this context. It facilitates collection of wildlife data in a non-invasive manner, continuously and over large areas, while avoiding the heavy cost associated with employing humanpower for manual surveys. However, the large scale data thus generated requires intensive analysis using advanced machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

I have done this work on data collected by Juliana Velez (julianav), a PhD student in the Fieberg Lab (PI: John Fieberg (jfieberg), Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology) at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I have used deep neural network (DNN) models to classify audio files as having cattle sounds present or absent. Tapir is one of the wildlife species (classified as "Endangered" by IUCN in 1996) that Juliana has collected data for. Owing to insufficient data for tapir, I've also performed data augmentation - generating new data using existing base dataset - with and without using DNNs. Though I do not train a model for detecting tapir in this repository, this will be done subsequently, and generated data will be useful for that.

All coding in this repository has been performed using Python. Data augmentation has been performed using SciPy and PyDub libraries. I have also written a variational autoencoder, a state of the art deep learning algorithm, for pre-processing/augmenting tapir data using PyTorch framework. For supervised classification task, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used. To this end, I made use of [OpenSoundscape](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape) framework, which comes as an open source library and uses PyTorch under the hood.

<!--## Data (Collection/description/set details/etymology!)-->
## Data

Acoustic data has been captured using [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) devices. Each measures $58 \times 48 \times 15 mm$, and is typically hung from a tree at a height of about $4m$. Most data has been recorded in the forests and adjoining cattle ranches in the Orinoquia region (also known as the Eastern Plains) of Columbia, in the period 2020-21.

There are millions of audio files, pertaining to wildlife and various disturbances in the form of domestic animals like cattle, dogs, and gunshot sounds. AudioMoth devices were configured to create $10 ~ sec$ long audio clips in FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) or WAV format. The clips typically have forest noise possibly with call(s) by the animal species under consideration in the foreground. The background could be other animals/birds calls, leaves rustling, twigs snapping as creatures move around, et cetera. A few thousand of these audio files have been labeled as having cattle sounds present or absent by Juliana, either manually or using pattern recognition tools available online (like Rainforest Connection's Arbimon). These are relevant for training the model to detect cattle absence/presence. For the data augmentation task, as mentioned before, the species of concern is mountain tapir. Only four audio records w/ tapir calls could be obtained from the study site. Consequently, some tapir data collected from Cali Zoo (Zoologico de Cali, Cali, Columbia) were also used.

In this repository, I have summarised the data in CSV files. The sub-directories cattle_pres and cattle_abs under Cattle directory contain the metadata for labeled audio files. Tapir metadata is under its corresponding directory.

<!--## Executive Summary (or Work summary...)-->
<a name="intro"></a>
## Introduction

The broad goal of the project is to understand the interaction between wildlife and domestic animals like cattle, dogs while also exploring the effect of poaching. The machine learning problem in this project pertains to identifying animal species in acoustic data collected as explained earlier. Since deep learning algorithms require a significant amount of training data, there is also a scope of generating synthetic data points for the species which there are insufficient audio clips for.

Ideally, one would expect the model to identify all the species in the given data. However, for simplicity, the classification model in this repository is restricted to presence/absence of one species, which is a binary classification problem. For this purpose, I have focused on cattle. Accordingly, the model needs to be trained with a dataset containing records for the presence and absence of cattle. Here, a $2$-dimensional convolutional network is used for this purpose, which performs best on data with spatial features. In an image, nearby pixels are usually related to each other thereby making spectrogram image (a frequency vs time graphical representation generated from acoustic waveform, more on this in the next section) relevant for use w/ a CNN. Additionally, the second problem addressed in this repository pertains to tapir data. Since only a handful of raw audio records w/ tapir sounds could be collected, data augmentation needs to be performed on them, so as to inflate the size of the tapir positive/presence dataset. I have done this at the level of audio signals and at the level of spectrograms. The synthetic data thus generated will potentially be useful for future work on tapir absence/presence classification modelling problem.

<a name="spec"></a>
## Spectrogram

A common approach to deep learning with sound data (e.g., in speech recognition) is to generate a spectrogram, which is a diagram showing how frequency varies with time (i.e., a frequency vs time plot) in an acoustic signal. It represents different frequencies in different colours, signifying the amplitude (or loudness) of each frequency in the signal. For the problems in this repository, though the goal is not to identify a sequence of letters from a sound (which is so in speech recognition task), spectrograms offer a very useful starting point.

To obtain a spectrogram, an acoustic signal is first divided into a number of segments and each is Fourier transformed. (Fourier transformation is a procedure to decompose a waveform into linear combination of its constituent frequencies: $a_1 f_1 + a_2 f_2 + \cdot\cdot\cdot$, where $a_i$ is the amplitude of the frequency $f_i$.) The Fourier transforms for each segment are then combined into a single plot. I show a sample spectrogram later.

It turns out that humans perceive a very small range of frequencies, because of which a frequency vs time plot is not very informative. Further, our perception of the difference between two sounds is not in terms of the difference between their frequencies, but in terms of the logarithm of their ratio. To exemplify, the distinction between two sounds w/ frequencies $10 Hz$ and $20 Hz$ is much more than that between sounds of frequencies $100 Hz$ and $110 Hz$. Based on psychoacoustic experiments, there is a consensus that [mel scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) offers a good representation of the frequencies that humans typically hear. Similar to frequency, humans also perceive loudness logarithmically, which is quantified using Decibel scale. Our perceptions of frequency and loudness are accounted for using mel spectrograms, which have mel scale on the y axis and colour signifies decibel levels.

<a name="speccode"></a>
### Code specifics

Mel spectrogram is most commonly generated using librosa (through librosa.feature.melspectrogram() method) or torchaudio (through torchaudio.transforms.MelSpectrogram class) libraries. For the purpose of synthetic audio signal generation, spectrograms are only used for specifying the temporal location of the tapir call. Accordingly, I've created spectrograms depicting logarithmic frequency against time. This I've achieved using spectrogram() method of scipy.signal module. This method takes the numpy array, created from the Audiosegment object for the corresponding audio file, as an argument. An example can be seen in the figure below, where the frequency is in $log_{10}$ scale. Such frequency blobs stacked on top of each other typically correspond to a nasal sound from a mammal.

## Problems with sparse tapir data

As stated before, tapir data will be relevant for future work involving ML modelling for identifying tapir presence/absence in the audio. Since there were four audio files from the study site containing five tapir calls in all, this was certainly insufficient to train the model. Further, the five tapir sounds I had were not all distinct. From [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065771/), I found that there are $11$ types of tapir calls implying that the dataset I had was not fully representative. While it's possible to generate new records using the existing ones, such data augmentation will not solve the representativeness problem just described. Accordingly, I requested the Fieberg Lab to include some of the tapir audio records obtained from the Cali Zoo.

Cali Zoo has one tapir enclosure and the data is collected using three AudioMoth devices. Though these are placed at different locations, their range is long enough to capture tapir sounds from their enclosure. Each of them records and saves audio clips at various times of the day. The clips recorded by two or more AudioMoths at a particular time of the day have the same tapir sound, but with different background on account of the location of each AudioMoth device. While this brings in much more tapir data, for the purpose of representativeness problem discussed in the last paragraph, the number of relevant new clips is just the 'union' of the clips from the three AudioMoths (each clip used exactly once). This increased the number of tapir calls in the base dataset (which is used to generate synthetic data) to $19$.

## Generating synthetic audio clips

Juliana was recommended by OpenSounscape developers to use $5 ~ sec$ long clips for training the model written using this framework. Accordingly, I ensured that all the audio clips resulting from the data augmentation procedure are of $5$ seconds duration, so that they can be used for subsequent training of a model to detect tapir presence. In my opinion, the recommendation of $5 ~ sec$ clips is in line with the way convolutional network is trained for classification in the OpenSoundscape's [CNN tutorial](http://opensoundscape.org/en/latest/tutorials/cnn.html). As can be seen on this webpage, the machine learning classification task is performed sans hyperparameter tuning, which leaves making educated speculations about certain parameters of the model (e.g., batch size). (At this point, it is worth mentioning that OpSo does have a default implementation of learning rate scheduling in the form of stair case delay. Learning rate is multiplied by a cooling factor of $.7$ every $10$ epochs. The [advanced tutorial](http://opensoundscape.org/en/latest/tutorials/cnn_training_advanced.html) also shows a way to modify the scheduling by changing the cooling factor.) It is intuitively understood that clips of arbitrarily short duration should make it easier for the model to locate the tapir call amid the background, making the performance of a randomly chosen CNN model better. However, model training w/ too short clips is very slow, and $5$ seconds offers a good balance.

First, I describe the procedure of generating synthetic audio clips. I have done this using what I would like to call the 'controlled' method. (The choice of this terminology will be clear soon.) To understand the mechanism, consider the spectrogram shown next.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83636458/194688632-39b7fe1f-4cf9-4c5b-8c48-1a63aa89d4a9.png"/>
        <br>
        <em> Spectrogram of an audio clip showing $log(freq)$ vs $time$. There is a tapir call between $7s$ and $8s$ </em>
    </p>
The spike in frequency as seen fairly localised between $7s$, $8s$ on time axis represents a tapir call. I moved the tapir frequency spike in time, with each new clip created out of this one having the frequency spike at different time instances. (Note, that while I'm explaining this using spectrogram, this has been carried out at the level of audio clips.) I have done this in two different ways, distinction being in the background of the tapir call. Next, I describe, and give arguments for, each.

* In the first approach, I generate records having complete silence in the background of the tapir sound. To understand the rationale for this, consider a hypothetical classification model trained with audio clips each having at least one tapir sound. During the training phase, the model will need to isolate the tapir call out of the $5$ seconds long clip. Since the training data for tapir presence is sparse, it seems sensible to have complete silence in the clip other than at the instance of the tapir call. In a way, this makes it convenient for the model to isolate the tapir call out of the background.

* In the second approach, I use the guiding principle that the subsequent classification model for detecting tapir absence/presence should be trained with real data, like would be encountered during the testing phase. Different test files would obviously have various types of background noises in various combinations and orders. Accordingly, I generate new $5 ~ sec$ clips containing one tapir sound with forest noises in the background. One way to make this project more relevant to the larger community is to use background noises from different landscapes, in the background of tapir calls. However, given the small amount of base data, I have decided to stick with the backgrounds relevant to this project, which, as mentioned before, could be other animals/birds calls, leaves rustling, twigs snapping as creatures move around, et cetera. This still leaves the following question: how to choose the background forest noises of duration $(5 - length$ $of$ $tapir$ $call)$ seconds from the $10 ~ sec$ long clip? There are indeed various ways, the best and the simplest one, in my opinion, is the following. Use the background from either the first $5 ~ sec$ or the last $5 ~ sec$ chunk of the $10 ~ sec$ raw clip, depending on which one the tapir call happens to be in. To exemplify, if the original $10$ seconds audio clip has two tapir calls - one between $3s$, $4s$ and another between $6s$, $7s$, then I use the first tapir sound and the first $5$ seconds of the audio to generate $5$ clips, with the tapir sound starting at locations $0s$, $1s$, $2s$, $3s$, $4s$. And using the tapir sound between $6s$, $7s$ in the raw clip, I use the section of the audio from $6$ to $10 ~ sec$ to create another $5$ clips.

Both these methods require the chunk of audio w/ tapir sound to be separated out of the $10 ~ sec$ long audio signal, which requires identifying the temporal location of the tapir sound in the clip. I played (listened to) each record to identify, to within a second, the location of the tapir call, and looked for a discernable pattern within that one second in the corresponding spectrogram.

### Code specifics

As explained, I have generated synthetic audio clips in two ways. For silence in background, I generated chunks of silence with silent() class method of AudioSegment. For each audio file, I created an AudioSegment instance using from_file('filename') class method, and extracted a chunk of this clip from $a$ to $b ~ msec$ using [a:b] (similar to slicing a numpy array). For naming new clips generated using a particular clip, I used the stem property of PurePath('existing_clip_name') instance.

## An alternative - controlled spectrogram augmentation

At this point, it is worth noting that in this method of data augmentation, I've worked at the level of audio clips. It is equally possible to enhance the dataset using spectrograms corresponding to the audio clips in the base dataset. Since the spectrogram is a pictorial frequency vs time representation, this involves working with images. One advantage of working with spectrograms in a controlled manner is that both frequency band and time duration of tapir sound are accessible. Such an analysis can be found in the [literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779), and exploits both frequency-masking and time-masking. In this repository, I choose to not perform controlled augmentation of spectrogram data since the analysis goes on similar lines as audio augmentation. However, in the next section, I explore the viability of a state of the art deep learning algorithm for enhancing tapir present spectrogram data. This could be useful for those in the larger community who want to do modelling starting from spectrogram images.

## Variational autoencoder to generate synthetic spectrogram images

Variational autoencoder is a neural network based generative (in that it attempts to identify the structure of the data so as to simulate the data generation process), unsupervised (in that it doesn't require class labels for training) algorithm. It was proposed by [Kingma and Welling in 2013](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1312.6114).

### Introduction

Consider a neural network that applies a set of non-linear transformations to the input data (to reduce its dimension) and maps it to a probability distribution, from which a latent vector is sampled. This network is an encoder. Another neural network, a decoder, then maps the latent vector back to the original input space using non-linear transformations. Essentially, the encoder compresses the data while the decoder decompresses it.

        <br>
        <em> Representation of a variational autoencoder. Image sourced from [internet](https://avandekleut.github.io/assets/vae/variational-autoencoder.png) </em>
    </p>
As stated before, the input data is encoded as distribution over latent space random variable. The latent space thus obtained is continuous (as opposed to vae's architectural cousin - an autoencoder - where input data is deterministically mapped to the latent space). Further, one of the loss functions to be minimised during training is Kulback-Leibler divergence, which also penalises the distribution for deviating from standard Gaussian. This effectively enforces the requirement that the variance should be close to an identity matrix and mean should be small. This makes the generative process possible.

Let's call the latent random variable $z$. Suppose the encoded distribution is $q_\phi(z|x)$, where $x$ is the training data. Hence, $q_\phi(z|x)$ corresponds to the encoder. Decoder is the likelihood $p_\theta(x|z)$, where $\theta$ represents the parameters of the model. $q_\phi(z|x)$ is the variational approximation to the intractable posterior of the model $p_\theta(z|x)$ $(\theta$ being the model parameter), and accordingly, $\phi$ represents the variational parameters. Posterior distribution is initially represented by a prior $p(z)$ (which is assumed to be a unit normal distribution $N(0,1))$, that will be subsequently updated. As mentioned earlier, the latent random variable is sampled from the encoded distribution, i.e. $z ~ \sim ~ q_\phi(z|x)$. This makes calculating the gradient of one of the terms in KL divergence (which is required during backpropagation) cumbersome. To overcome this, the authors proposed a reparametrisation trick, which involves expressing the random variable $z$ as a deterministic variable. If it is assumed that the posterior is approximately normal, then so would the variational approximation to the posterior $(q_\phi(z|x))$ be. In this case, the reparameterised latent vector can be represented as $z ~ = ~ \mu ~ + ~ \sigma \cdot \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is an auxillary noise variable $\epsilon ~ \sim ~ N(0,1)$.

### Architecture of the variational autoencoder

Both encoder and decoder part of the algorithm contain neural network layers. Since I'm working with images, I have employed an architecture containing convolution and pooling layers for changing spatial resolution of the data. For spatially connected data, these layers are superior to a network of fully connected layers for a number of reasons, which I discuss next.

For an image with $\sim ~ 10^2 ~ \times ~ 10^2$ pixels, a fully connected network with $100$ nodes in the hidden layers would have $\sim ~ 10^{10}$ (or $10$ billion) parameters! In a convolution layer, on the other hand, each neuron connects to only its receptive field. In simpler terms, a pixel in any layer is connected to only a local group of pixel in the previous layer. This is called sparse connectivity, and is a reasonable expectation because of locality - nearby pixels are expected to be more informative than a grouping of distant pixels. In addition to this, there is weight sharing within the receptive field. This further reduces the parameters of the model.

In the context of vision architectures, the weights in question are typically arranged in a filter or kernel, which is essentially a $k \times k$ matrix (and can be represented as a $2d$ array) for my purpose. For detecting a particular feature (say, an edge), there would be a filter. An image is a $2d$ matrix with each element representing the number of pixels, typically between $0$ and $255$. Convolution operation is performed between this filter and a patch of image at having the size of the filter. The filter then moves to the next patch. Each convolution generates a scalar (or a number), leading to a matrix once the whole image is covered. This is called a feature map, and represents a particular type of feature (say, a horizontal edge) in the image.

The fact that the weights in the filter are learnt during training is what makes convnets so powerful. Essentially, what features are to be extracted are learnt by the algorithm. The feature maps generated by the convolution layer are further passed through a pooling layer. Its purpose is to reduce the size (or dimensionality) of the feature maps. It summarises the features in the input, through averaging, or selecting maximum of each section. This has a very important consequence - invariance. While in the original image, the location or orientation of the subject might have been relevant, the summarised feature map is invariant to translation/deformation.

### Code specifics

Raw audio clips have just $19$ tapir sounds. This few data points, however, are abysmally low to train a DNN. Hence, my base dataset for generating synthetic spectrogram images comes from the controlled audio augmentation with background, which was discussed above. Accordingly, I have $95$ spectrogram images, which I perform data augmentation on. Using these images, I create an instance of ImageFolder (torchvision library), while transforming them to tensor (which PyTorch works with). ImageFolder instance is further used to create DataLoder instance, which is how data is fed to a PyTorch model.

The architecture I use for an encoder is a set of $6$ layers, each set containing a $2$-dimensional convolution layer, a ReLU activation function (to learn non-linearity), a batch normalisation layer (to normalise the data), and a max pooling layer in sequence. These 6 layers are followed by fully connected layers for reading distributions for mean and variance of the training data. The image resolution is down-sampled, while increasing the number of channels. Accordingly, each convolution layer has more filters than the previous one. The input data (in the form of DataLoader instance) is given to the encoder, which returns mean and (logarithmic) variance. This is followed by reparameterisation of the latent vector, which is then passed to the decoder to return a reconstructed image. The decoder I've written up-samples the data using $6$ layers, each containing a $2d$ transposed convolution with stride (for up-sampling), a ReLU activation function, and a batch normalisation layer in sequence.

The loss function I've used is the sum of binary cross entropy and KL divergence. I used Adam optimiser, which offers a modified form of stochastic gradient descent. I experimented with learning rates of $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$, $10^{-5}$, and a stepwise decay w/ learning rate starting at $10^{-4}$ and being multiplied by $0.5$ every $10$ epochs. Finally, I settled for $10^{-5}$. There's a [consensus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/cifar-10-classification-using-optimization-for-tensorflow.html) that processors perform better if batch size is a power of $2$. Since I have only $95$ data points to begin with, I used a batch size of $32$, which is relatively smaller than what I would have preferred. For number of epochs, I choose a rather large value of $800$ because of the small dataset.

There are two ways to use variational autoencoder in the validation phase. One is to use the probability distribution of the input image dataset learnt during training phase to reconstruct the images. The other is to pass Gaussian distribution to the decoder and generate synthetic images. The distribution being passed is for the latent random variable, and is exactly Gaussian, as against the learnt distribution which would be approximately Gaussian. Accordingly, the latter approach generates images somewhat different from the original ones.

The loss curve (which is a plot of average loss vs epochs) I obtained is quite as expected. The error decreases fast, which is expected from such powerful algorithms, even more so for small datasets. The reconstructed images appear to fall short of the mark, particularly for sharp, sudden sounds (which tapir calls are like) nearly represented by a delta function. I believe there are two possible reasons - very small training dataset, and images in the training set not being independent (since they are generated from 19 tapir sounds using controlled method). Synthetic images are obviously more distant from the original ones given the latent space random variable is sampled from exactly normal distribution, which would be different from the distribution followed by the from the input data. <!--Using a decaying learning rate isn't making much difference here, possibly because the images contain only low lever features.-->

## Binary classification

As mentioned before, some of the raw audio files have been labeled as cattle presence/absence (summarised under Data directory). The idea is to use this labelled audio data for training the model. There are about five times more labeled cattle present clips than cattle absent. This would seemingly lead to an imbalance in the dataset. However, from an ecological perspective, such imbalance for abundant species is useful. This can be understood from the diagram next.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg/396px-Precisionrecall.svg.png"/>
        <br>
        <em> Precision and recall in statistics. Image by Walber - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, from [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=36926283) </em>
    </p>

For rare species, there are expected to be only a few events, implying that recall should be high. Cattle on the other hand are ubiquitous, and many sounds (relevant events) are expected. Accordingly, precision should be maximised at the cost of recall for such commonly occuring sounds. Indeed, the training data for cattle that I have has high precision. (A reasonable metric to measure performance of the model is $F1$ score, since it makes takes into consideration both precision and recall.) Further, there are $\sim 700$ cattle absent audio files, signalling that synthetic data generation is not required.

Audio waveform is a time-series. Accordingly, it is natural to consider 1D ConvNets (employing time-only convolutions) for acoustic signals. However, in the last few years, a consensus has been achieved that these models are mostly inferior to (unless made very deep, in that case they could be as good as) $2d$ vision architectures. Hence, it makes sense to take the latter approach - using $2$-dimensional convolutional neural network. Further, I make use of OpenSoundscape framework. It offers the use of various vision architectures, like ResNet, VGG, etc., while abstracting most of the technical details from the users.

Training DNNs (deep neural networks) typically requires tremendous amount of data and advanced hardware. Transfer learning is an approach to supervised classification, which is relevant in cases where there isn't copious amounts of data to train the model with from scratch, or if there isn't a GPU available. Transfer learning approach employs models pre-trained on an exising database. Though the weights have been learnt, they may still need to be fine-tuned using data relevant to the problem at hand.

## OpenSoundscape framework

OpSo offers a way to write species classification models using existing machine vision architectures. It abstracts most of the algorithmic and coding details away from the user. The framework takes audio clips and generates spectrogram images from them, which are further used for training machine vision architectures. OpenSoundscape initialises the model architectures with weights pre-trained on [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) database by default, which is a dataset of millions of labeled images. It is also possible to load weights from a path on one's machine or a url.

The model is conceptually divided between feature extractor part and a classifier part. Feature extractor consists of a number of convolution, pooling layers (similar to the architecture I wrote for variational autoencoder) closer to the input. These layers have filters which help extract the features in an image (like edges, eyes) while reducing its dimensions. The classifier part consists of fully-connected layers farthest from the input image. It uses the high level feature maps generated by the layers just before and predicts the class label for the image. In OpSo, it is possible to initialise the weights of one or both of these parts, train the two parts with different learning rates, and even freeze the feature extractor altogether (in which case the gradients are not computed).

Though OpSo a user-friendly deep learning framework, I believe that it is lacking in some areas. The foremost being in the context of hyperparameter optimisation. While there exists a default learning rate scheduling, and it can also be modified, there is no tuning for batch size, which I believe is also an important parameter. For number of epochs, early stopping with validation loss as stopping criterion is used. However, in cases when there is insufficient training data, it may not be possible to separate a holdout set for validation. Then, number of epochs may also need to be tuned.

### Code specifics

I have used a ResNet18 network pre-trained on ImageNet with the feature extractor frozen. This is coded in [opensoundscape.torch.architectures.resnet](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape/blob/be1b77ee85c403996a34f92f2662d7a0f427ff0e/opensoundscape/torch/architectures/resnet.py) module. I take this approach because the images appear to have only low level features, and ImageNet weights should present a fairly good estimate for the feature extractor. This makes the training faster.

Important default parameters in opso (hence used in my code as well) are as follows. Loss function for binary classification: cross entropy loss; optimiser parameters: [SGD](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html) algorithm, $lr$ (learning rate) $= ~ .01$, momentum $= ~ .9$, weight decay $= ~ .0005$., performance metric: F1 score (for single-target models). Default parameters for [StepLR](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR.html) (step wise learning rate decay): step size $= ~ 10$, gamma $= ~ .7$.

I did one-hot encoding for the cattle data, and split the data in training and holdout sets. I used ResNet18 architecture to instantiate [CNN](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape/blob/be1b77ee85c403996a34f92f2662d7a0f427ff0e/opensoundscape/torch/models/cnn.py) (which is the class containing train method). Batch size of $512$ and $100$ epochs were used with validation loss as the criterion for early stopping. I had the results of each run written to a csv file.
