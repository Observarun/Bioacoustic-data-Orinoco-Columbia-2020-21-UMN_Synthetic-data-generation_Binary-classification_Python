# Binary Species Classification from Bio-acoustic Data


## Business Case

Human activity and climate change have been placing ever increasing pressure on biodiversity. Acoustic monitoring is seeing growing use in ecology and conservation biology research since it facilitates collection of data in a non-invasive manner continuously and over large areas. Such large scale data requires intensive analysis using advanced machine learning/deep learning algorithms.

In this work, which I did in collaboration w/ a PhD student in the Fieberg lab (Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology) at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, I have used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify audio files as having cattle sounds or not using [OpenSoundscape](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape) library, which uses PyTorch under the hood.
